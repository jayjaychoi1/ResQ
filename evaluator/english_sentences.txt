It rained.
She disappeared.
Something happened.
Mama cried.
Anybody home?
Be patient.
Be yourself.
Be cheerful.
I understood.
Stop worrying.
Eat slowly.
Hi, Tom!
Forget me.
Everyone wins.
What nonsense!
Tom shrugged.
Tom wept.
Tom kneeled.
Sign here.
Tom nodded.
Nobody died.
My ass!
Step back.
Sit down.
Call me.
Back off.
Just relax.

He spoke.
Stand up.
He resigned.
I work.
Greetings, stranger.
